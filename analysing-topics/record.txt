To get the timestamp file:
first, initialise the timestamp file
> rostopic echo -b <bagfile> > <timestampfile>
then, add other timestamps from other topics
> rostopic echo -b <bagfile> >> <timestampfile>
After everything is okay, run the Rscript.
> Rscript make-graph.R <timestampfile>
This will produce a "timestamp-graph.png" file.	

I automatised the making of graph from the timestamp.csv. 
I could use the "Rscript make-graph.R <filename>" to make the graph.
I need to find out a way to draw the grid properly.
I also need to find out a way to use python. 

For the timestamp.csv file, 
I tried to use 4 different topics, which are:
1. /base_waypoints
2. /cluster_centroids
3. /current_velocity
4. /detection/lidar_detector/cloud_clusters


What if:
1. I write a shellscript to diagnose if there is the timestamp
2. Based on the diagnosed result, I get the timestamps from them
timeout 30 <code> in shellscript
3. Then, from the timestamps, pipe it to Rscript to make the graph
4. Then I create a topic-index list ot go with it
