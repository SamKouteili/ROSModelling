To get the timestamp file:
first, initialise the timestamp file
> rostopic echo -b <bagfile> > <timestampfile>
then, add other timestamps from other topics
> rostopic echo -b <bagfile> >> <timestampfile>
After everything is okay, run the Rscript.
> Rscript make-graph.R <timestampfile>
This will produce a "timestamp-graph.png" file.	

I automatised the making of graph from the timestamp.csv. 
I could use the "Rscript make-graph.R <filename>" to make the graph.
I need to find out a way to draw the grid properly.
I also need to find out a way to use python.
